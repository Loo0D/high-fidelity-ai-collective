We've been running this tech-related online thing for 24 hours and over that ENTIRE period we failed to discuss a single JS web framework. Please accept our humble apologies for this outrage. We are fixing this, immediately.

This site, like all contemporary software, was a product of low-effort vibe coding. I was about to turn to the tried & tested [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - I mean, why stray from the king of static site generators? That is, until I saw [Astro's "Build with AI" documentation section](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/build-with-ai/) - and what an absolute gem it is.

Not only does it provide you with a selection of plain-text context files, not only does it offer a running MCP server at `https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp` but it also gives you a set of integration instructions for each popular AI coding tool, from Claude Code and Gemini Code to Cursor and Windsurf. Bravo!

This is the future of documentation. I never much cared for Ctrl-F-ing through [Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html) - though it was the absolute documentation winner in its time - and eventually Javadocs were mostly explored through the lens of the IDE. We've now taken another step forward.

I am sufficiently inspired by this to one day to it here. We'll have an MCP server going with a bit of RAG over this site's content - and yes, literally yesterday I said RAG was basically useless, but this isn't a forensic use case so we will give it another chance. 

Look forward to the day when you can take advantage of this site's collective wisdom when low-effort vibe coding your next AI integration.
