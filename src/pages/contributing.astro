      <p>
        To contribute an article, a case study, or a technical deep-dive, please follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Fork the repository</strong> on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. This creates your own copy of the project to work on.</li>
        <li><strong>Create a new Markdown file</strong> in the <code>src/content/posts/</code> directory.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow the frontmatter template</strong> to provide a title, publication date, and description. For example:
          <pre><code>---
title: "Your Post Title"
pubDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"
description: "A brief summary of your post."
author: "Your Name or GitHub handle"
---</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Write your content</strong> using standard Markdown. Share your insights, a case study, or a technical deep-dive.</li>
        <li><strong>Submit a Pull Request</strong>. Once you are happy with your post, you can propose your changes to the main repository. From your forked repository on GitHub, you will see an option to "Contribute" and "Open a pull request". Follow the instructions to submit it. For a detailed guide, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub's documentation on creating a pull request</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Your contribution will be reviewed by the community and published. We look forward to seeing what you share!
